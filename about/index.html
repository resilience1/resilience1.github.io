		<h2>Michael Ryan Lengefeld is Visiting Assistant Professor of Environmental Sociology 
		at Goucher College. His focus on social justice guides his research and work 
		with community organizations, such as the Food Recovery Network and the Goucher 
		Prison Education Project. Professor Lengefeld teaches courses in Sociology and 
		Environmental Studies, with a focus on social and environmental transformation. 
		His research examines the intersection of political ecology and war, with emphasis 
		on the ways in which the developing tension between war and society has transformed
		the global ecology. <br><br>
				
		Dr. Lengefeldâ€™s comparative-historical work on the environmental consequences of 
		Cold War nuclear weapons production and the U.S. War on Drugs in Latin America is 
		published in the <i>Journal of World-Systems Research, Human Ecology Review, and Armed 
			Forces and Society</i>.
