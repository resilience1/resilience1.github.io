Why did Narcotraffic increase in Mexico between 1990 and the present day?

Head over to Sam Cohen's Global Social Trends website to see an award-winning response to this question <a href="https://www.samuelcohn.net/april-winner/">here</a>! 

Two central dynamics facilitated the increase in Mexican narcotrafficking organizations since 1990.

1. The reorganization of the global cocaine commodity chain resulting from the collapse of the Colombian narcotrafficking in the late 1980s.

2. The 1990s shift towards democratic pluralism in Mexican domestic politics.

The American Drug War spurred the collapse of the Colombian narcotrafficking and pushed coca production to ecologically sensitive regions of Peru and Bolivia. 
The shutdown of the traditional Caribbean narcotrafficking routes facilitated the growth of Mexican NTOs as the central route to U.S. drug markets, which led 
to their domination of trafficking in the cocaine commodity chain.

The Mexican political shift towards democratic pluralism in the 1990s undermined the long-standing system of collusion among Mexican security forces and Mexican 
narcotraffickers. The old Mexican drug gangs no longer had impunity. They split into the nine major drug gangs of today.
