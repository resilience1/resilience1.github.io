	<h1>What you need to know</h1>
		<h2>War and preparation for war have harmful environmental impacts, but not every nation uses the same strategies.
			There has been a dramatic shift in the way contemporary wars are fought, and the environmental consequences have also
			changed. In the modern era, many developed nations have shifted to a new form of high-tech warfare termed 
			"risk-transfer militarism."

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Environmental destruction always results from war, but as war changes, so do its environmental 
					consequences. Modern wars are fought in a way that shifts environmental consequences to
					the Global South. Since the United States militarized its effort in the war on drugs in 1981,
					it has provided equipment, training, and weaponry to the Colombian state. Since 2000, the United 
					States has supported the Colombian state through "Plan Colombia." There are numerous 
					state and non-state violent groups participating in the war on drugs, and human rights abuses
					and environmental degradation are widespread. The United States remains insulated from the 
					environmental and human rights consequences of this war; Colombia bears the costs in war casualties,
					environmental damage, and the underdevelopment of peripheral regions where coca growing occurs.

			<h1>What did the researcher do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers located and analyzed academic research, media, and governmental publications
					on the environmental damage resulting from the militarized war on drugs in Colombia. They 
					identified historical and social factors that led to cocaine production and organized revolutionary 
					anti-government groups. They document American efforts to suppress the drug trade and the
					consequences for the Colombian government, the natural environment, and peoples of 
					Colombia.

			<h1>What did the researcher find?</h1>
				<h2>Despite the United States involvement in this conflict, the harmful environmental effects are
					disproportionately borne by Colombia. The Colombian military, paramilitary, guerilla, and criminal
					   forces all contribute to the environmental damage that occurs in Colombia. This is consistent
					   with how wars are now fought - the consequences are shifted to the Global South.<br><br>
				</h2>
					   
				<h2>Eradicating cocaine production involves harmful environment consequences. For example, 
					aerial fumigation to destroy crops of cocaine-producing coca plants distributes harmful chemicals 
					into the environment, and these chemicals bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in the food chain.
					The threats to biodiversity are significant because many newly established coca-growing
					regions are biodiversity "hotspots"; Colombia is home to the largest number of bird species
					in the world and the second highest number of plant species in the world. Coca production and eradication
					drive cycles of deforestation. When efforts to eradicate coca plants damage legal crops, 
					farmers either turn to producing coca themselves to supplement their income, or converting forested
					land into farmland. Cocaine production involves unsustainable cultivation techniques and use of toxins. 
					Coca leaves are ground into coca paste, which requires the use of large amounts of water and several toxic chemicals.
					Coca producers do not anticipate their crops being around for many years and so use liberal amounts of chemicals 
					on their plants, further compromising the integrity of local and regional water sources.

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>Governments can be reminded that militarized efforts to suppress the drug trade have negative environmental
				consequences. Understanding the effects the drug trade has on the ecosystem can help governments create
				less damaging strategies to eradicate the drug trade. Environmental organisations may use this research
				to inform their strategies for areas where drug production is prevalent. This research has been used by
				the Colombian government to ban the use of aerial fumigation on coca crops.

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Risk-tranfer militarism shifts the attendant risks of war - both the latent and manifest consequences - 
    				to the peoples and the environments of the Global South. Simultaneously, this trend in warmaking is a significant driver of carbon
    				emissions at the global scale, and it differs significantly for developed and and lesser developed countries; the resource- and 
    				technologically-intensive warmaking of the developed countries accelerates carbon emissions. Perhaps more importantly, the 
    				environmental consequences of this warmaking drives carbon emissions even in times of global Recession - when the slow-down of
    				the global economy reduce the impact of GDP on carbon emissions. This research further supports the evidence that warmaking has 
    				qualitatively unique impacts on the environment which cannot be reduced to capitalism, although the potential for synergy among
    				the two is apparent.</h2>
