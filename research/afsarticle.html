		<h1>What you need to know</h1>
           		<h2>We recently passed the 16-year anniversary of the American-led intervention in 
            		<a href="https://theintercept.com/2018/04/09/video-a-brief-history-of-u-s-intervention-in-iraq-over-the-past-half-century/">Iraq
            		</a>. The Gulf War of the 1990s involved the destruction of oil infrastructures and sewage treatment plants, as well as the 
            		use of depleted uranium munitions that resulted in congenital malformations in children that previously did not exist in 
            		medical journals. As we contemplate the enduring consequences of this intervention for human rights and political stability 
            		in Iraq, it's also useful to think about how this intervention fits into the broader context of state warmaking around the world. 
            		The Gulf War in the 1990s coincided with what is now known as the "Revolution in Military Affairs." In our recent piece published in 
		    	<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0095327X19832615"><i>Armed Forces and Society</i>
            		</a>, Chad Smith and I consider the environmental consequences of this "new war" - and we show how warmaking varies by developed 
		    	and lesser developed countries:</h2>

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Risk-tranfer militarism shifts the attendant risks of war - both the latent and manifest consequences - 
    				to the peoples and the environments of the Global South. Simultaneously, this trend in warmaking is a significant driver of carbon
    				emissions at the global scale, and it differs significantly for developed and and lesser developed countries; the resource- and 
    				technologically-intensive warmaking of the developed countries accelerates carbon emissions. Perhaps more importantly, the 
    				environmental consequences of this warmaking drives carbon emissions even in times of global Recession - when the slow-down of
    				the global economy reduce the impact of GDP on carbon emissions. This research further supports the evidence that warmaking has 
    				qualitatively unique impacts on the environment which cannot be reduced to capitalism, although the potential for synergy among
    				the two is apparent.</h2>
