	<h1>What you need to know</h1>
		<h2>War and preparation for war entail harmful environmental impacts. There has been a dramatic historical shift 
			in the way contemporary wars are fought, and the environmental consequences have also changed. 
			Many nations of the Global North have pursued "asymmetrical warfare" which relies on high-tech and 
			resource-intensive warfare. Parallel to this shift is the national security threat of climate 
			change - an issue which must be addressed by the global community. This warmaking strategy 
			minimizes risks in the Global North and disproportionately shifts the attendant risks of war 
			such as casualties, forced displacement, and environmental damage in the Global South.

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Military strategies change to accommodate existing technologies. During the 1990s the 
					United States underwent a "Revolution in Military Affairs" and battle-tested its first 
					"smart" weapons in the 1991 Gulf War. These innovative technogies were accompanied by new
					operational tactics that relied on shifting risks away from the homeland and its soldiers.
					Competing national militaries were compelled to match the strategy of asymmetric warfare 
					pursued by the United States, driving a high-tech and resource-intensive arms race
					across the world. By the year 2000 many national militaries were undergoing their 
					own revolution in military affairs, while simultaneously over the next decade the world
					grappled with the terrorist attacks on 9/11, two global economic recessions, and two 
					decadelong wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.

			<h1>What did the researcher do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers located and analyzed academic, government, and non-governmental data to understand 
					the impact of national military characteristics on carbon emissions. They performed a
					longitudinal and socio-spatial analysis by regression that included 126 countries from 2000 to 2010.

			<h1>What did the researcher find?</h1>
				<h2>Risk-tranfer militarism shifts the attendant risks of war to the peoples and the environments of the 
					Global South. This trend in warmaking is a significant driver of carbon emissions at the global 
					scale, but it differs significantly between developed and lesser developed countries: the Global North
					is pursuing a strategy that relies on carbon-intensive advanced weaponry while the Global South is investing in more boots
					on the ground. Perhaps more importantly, this warmaking drives carbon emissions even in times of global 
					Recession - when the slow-down of the global economy is reducing the impact of gross domestic product on carbon emissions.
				</h2><br><br>
					   
				<h2>The manufacturing, maintenance, and distribution of weapons of war has many harmful environmental impacts.
					Many advanced weapons rely on precious metals, toxic production processes, and require large amounts of energy.
					The use of fossil fuels in this process contributes significantly to the environmental footprint of 
					the military - and much of this energy is expended before the weapons are (if ever) deployed in war. 
					National militaries are compelled to keep up with their rivals. Depending on the geopolitical and social context,
					this could mean competing in an arms race, or ramping up military participation to reach parity with the enemy.

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>Governments can be reminded that military competition can undermine national security through its impacts
				on global climate change via increased carbon emissions. The effect is significant even during two global recessions, when the global economy
				experienced contractions and a reduced carbon footprint. Understanding the effects that asymmetric
				warfare has on global carbon emissions can help governments craft less environmentally destructive 
				strategies to protect national security interests. Environmental organizations may use this research
				to inform their stategies for applying pressure on governments who - while simultaneously acknowledging the national security
				threat of global climate change - are pursuing asymmetric warfare that significantly contributes
				to the carbon emissions driving global climate change.
