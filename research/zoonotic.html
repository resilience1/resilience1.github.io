	<h1>What you need to know</h1>
		<h2>The transmission of animal diseases to humans - zoonotic spillover - is occuring at a faster pace. Greater engagement between social 
			sciences and the biological sciences can contribute to understanding the causes of the increased frequency of what is a statistically rare event.

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>The threat of zoonotic spillover is accelerating. It is estimated that there are over 
					1.5 million unknown viruses in animal reservoirs; over 600,000 (perhaps as many as
					850,000) of these viruses have the potential to infect humans. There is a need for 
					collaboration between social and biological sciences if we are to anticipate and come 
					to terms with zoonotic spillover.

			<h1>What did the researcher do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers identified normal accidents and treadmill theory as concepts

			<h1>What did the researcher find?</h1>
			<h2>The concept of "<a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691004129/normal-accidents"><i>normal accidents</i> can 
				be applied to understanding the risk of zoonotic spillover. Zoonotic spillover is a relatively rare event, and although 
				humans are continually exposed to many potentially infectious pathogens that are derived from other species, most of
				these microorganisms cannot infect or cause disease in humans. Pathogen spillover events can be linked with human-animal
				interactions with both natural hosts (such as bats) and intermediate hosts (such as domesticated animals). Although the 
				risk posed by a single encounter or even several hundred encounters is quite low, the chance of spillover grows as the 
				number of encounters grows. If encounters are frequent enough, spillover becomes “normal” – in the Anthropocene
				these encounters are growing rapidly – and in some cases exponentially.
				
				Several human activities have already caused and elevate the risk of future zoonotic spillover, including climate change,
				hunting, human migration, landscape changes, livestock trade, and environmental contamination — and these threats have been
				accelerated with the process of globalization. A “treadmill of production” is derived from and propels economic competition;
				a “treadmill of destruction” is fueled by geopolitical and military rivalries. Treadmills of production and destruction 
				accelerate environmental degradation and heighten the risk of zoonotic spillover. The dangers posed by treadmills are 
				istinctive because powerful organizations exploit nature and extract resources in competition with rivals that threaten 
				their organizational vitality – and potentially their survival. These powerful organizations are caught on a treadmill of 
				environmental degradation – and the pace of degradation quickens.
