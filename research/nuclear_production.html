		<h1>What you need to know<h1>
			<h2>The environmental harms associated with economic activity are often 
				the focus of the Anthropocene. However, since 1945, the environmental impact of nuclear weapons 
				production has presented a threat to human wellbeing, ecosystem health, and biodiversity. 
				The ongoing environmental sacrifices
				made in the name of nuclear arms races and national security doctrines warrant far greater attention 
				in a discussion about the role of humans in transforming the planet.

		<h1>What is this research about?<h1>
			<h2>  An arms race always generates negative environmental impacts, but the Cold War nuclear arms race introduced
				unprecedented types and amounts of radioactive wastes into the environment. The production strategies used
				in this arms race were remarkably different from arms races in other eras of human warfare. The military
				guided a nexus of industrial, scientific, and technological production with one goal: build the most deadly 
				weapons in human history.<br><br>
				
				Plutonium is the most deadly and carcinogenic substance known to humans. Hanford reprocessed Plutonium-239 (P-239)
				from irradiated fuel rods for use in advanced nuclear weapons. The process of manufacturing P-239 required enormous amounts of water,
				the use of many caustic and deadly chemicals, and results in the generation of huge volumes and numerous types 
				of radioactive waste. There were many processes that could be used to accomplish plutonium reprocessing.
				PUREX was a process chosen for its high efficiency, but it was a double-edged sword; it produced even greater
				volumes of waste. The nearly 32 billion gallons of liquid waste (64% from PUREX) that were released seeped into the groundwater
				and created mounds that altered the local hydrology and sped the flow of water towards the Columbia River.<br><br>
				
				Rocky Flats manufactured P-239 cores. These cores are the primary component of modern nuclear weapons, the piece
				responsible for the chain reaction, and Rocky Flats produced nearly every core in the American nuclear arsenal. 
				In high concentrations required for weapons P-239 is uniquely dangerous because it can spontaneously ignite in air or undergo a chain reaction in the presence
				of water. P-239 had to be machined into precise cores for use in weapons, and the wastes produced in this process
				were the source of many dangerous accidents involving plutonium. There is a remarkable history of nuclear secrecy, denial, 
				and lies involving human health and ecological damages from plutonium core production at Rocky Flats. <br><br>
				
				Not all nuclear weapon designs are equally risky. One specific type of cores - <i>sealed-pit</i> cores - was itself a far 
				riskier choice of weapon design because any accident guaranteed a nuclear scattering incident; older "gun-style" designs kept the
				radioactive materials separate from the other bomb components until they were ready to be deployed. Military leaders 
				insisted that the risks of sealed-pit weapons were negligible, but declassified national security documents show otherwise. These weapons 
				have been involved in dozens of scattering events, some resulting in serious ecological catastrophe.

		<h1>What did the researcher do?<h1>
			<h2> The researcher located and analyzed academic research, media, governmental publications, and
				recently declassified national security documents on the environmental damage resulting from
				the production of nuclear weapons in the United States since the Manhattan Project. I 
				identified historical and social factors that led to the American effort in the Cold War nuclear 
				arms race. I document American efforts to "modernize" the nuclear arsenal and the resulting ecological 
				consequences for humand and all biological life.

		<h1>What did the researcher find?<h1>
			<h2>The American military established a "treadmill of destruction mechanism" to 
				compete in a nuclear arms race. In producing a nuclear arsenal, the military
				systematically privileged national security demands over the protection of 
				human health and the environment.<br><br>
				
				Hanford is the most radioactively contaminated space on Earth. The contamination is widespread and can
				be found bioaccumulating in the local water supply and foodchain via radioactive tumbleweeds, genetically instability in Colombia 
				River fish species, in the droppings of apex predators such as hawks, and in the thyroids of individuals in the surrounding communities.
				A new nuclear arms race threatens to add to the waste burden at Hanford, before the Cold War environmental legacy has been dealt with (if even possible).
				<br><br>
				
				Rocky Flats contaminated much of the Denver metro area with plutonium during the 1957 fire. It has been estimated by Dr. Helen Caldicott that
				one pound of plutonium - evenly distributed - could induce lung cancer in every human on earth. During Rocky Flats' operation
				no less than 1,100 pounds of plutonium were "lost" in the air ducts, drum, and glove boxes. Moreover, the sealed-pit cores
				contaminating Rocky Flats and Denver were a component of a high-risk nuclear weapon design, one that led to dozens of 
				nuclear scattering incidents. These secret nuclear accidents were classified until only recently, because they demonstrate
				the catastrophic risks posed both in the production and maintenance of nuclear arsenals - despite whether they are ever deployed
				on the battlefield.

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>In 2020, several countries are currently pursuing a new nuclear arms race. In the United 
				States, an effort is underway to convert former nuclear weapons sites into conservation spaces
				available for public use. 
				Governments and policy advocates can be reminded that historically, a nuclear arms race 
				results in ecological atrocities at local, regional, and global scales. The environmental consequences
				of the Cold War nuclear arms race have yet to be fully characterized, yet the United States is leading the 
				current push for a new nuclear arms race.
				Understanding the conditions that allow a treadmill mechanism to emerge reveals the conditions that <i>prevent</i>
				it from becoming established. This research can therefore help scholars and policy makers craft 
				national security strategies that take seriously the ecological threats posed by the creation
				of our own nuclear weapons. Environmental and nuclear disarmament organizations may use this 
				research to inform their strategies for addressing the intersecting and impending catastrophes 
				of global environmental change and nuclear weaponry.
