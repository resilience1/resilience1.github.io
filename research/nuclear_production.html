		<h1>What you need to know<h1>
			<h2>The environmental harms associated with economic activity are often 
				the focus of the Anthropocene. However, since 1945, the environmental impact of nuclear weapons 
				production has presented a threat to human wellbeing, ecosystem health, and biodiversity. 
				The ongoing environmental sacrifices
				made in the name of nuclear arms races and national security doctrines warrant far greater attention 
				in a discussion about the role of humans in transforming the planet.

		<h1>What is this research about?<h1>
			<h2>  An arms race always generates negative environmental impacts, but the Cold War nuclear arms race introduced
				unprecedented types and amounts of radioactive wastes into the environment. The production strategies used
				in this arms race were remarkably different from arms races in other eras of human warfare. The military
				guided a nexus of industrial, scientific, and technological production with one goal: build the most deadly 
				weapons in human history.<br><br>
				
				Hanford provided the primary material used in advanced nuclear weaponry - Plutonium 239. P-239 was reprocessed
				from fuel rods after irradiation in nuclear reactors. The process of manufacturing P-239 required enormous amounts of water,
				the use of many caustic and deadly chemicals, and results in the generation of huge volumes and numerous types 
				of radioactive waste. There were many processes that could be used to accomplish plutonium reprocessing.
				PUREX was a process chosen for its high efficiency, but it was a double-edged sword; it produced even greater
				volumes of waste. The nearly 32 billion gallons of liquid waste (64% from PUREX) that were released seeped into the groundwater
				and created mounds that altered the local hydrology and sped the flow of water towards the Colombia River.
				
				Rocky Flats manufactured P-239 cores. These cores are the primary component of modern nuclear weapons, the piece
				responsible for the chain reaction, and Rocky Flats produced nearly every core in the American nuclear arsenal. 
				Plutonium is the most deadly and carcinogenic substance known to humans. In high concentrations required for weapons,
				it is particularly dangerous, because it can spontaneously ignite in air and undergo a chain reaction in the presence
				of water. Plutonium had to be machined into precise cores for use in weapons, and the wastes produced in this process
				were the source of many dangerous accidents involving plutonium. There is a remarkable history of nuclear secrecy, denial, 
				and lies involving human health and ecological damages from plutonium pit production at Rocky Flats. 
				
				The choice to use core-based nuclear weapons designs
				was itself a far riskier decision because any accident guaranteed a nuclear scattering incident; older designs kept the
				radioactive materials separate from the other bomb components until they were ready to be deployed. Military leaders 
				insisted that the risks were negligible, but declassified national security documents show otherwise. These weapons 
				have been involved in dozens of scattering events, some resulting in serious ecological catastrophe.

		<h1>What did the researcher do?<h1>
			<h2> The researcher located and analyzed academic research, media, governmental publications, and
				recently declassified national security documents on the environmental damage resulting from
				the production of nuclear weapons in the United States since the Manhattan Project. I 
				identified historical and social factors that led to the American effort in the Cold War nuclear 
				arms race. I document American efforts to "modernize" the nuclear arsenal and the ecological 
				consequences for humanity and all biological life.

			<h2>The American military established a "treadmill of destruction mechanism" to

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>In 2020, several countries are currently pursuing a new nuclear arms race.
				Governments and policy advocates can be reminded that historically, a nuclear arms race 
				results in ecological atrocities at local, regional, and global scales. Understanding the 
				conditions that allow a treadmill mechanism to emerge reveals the conditions that <i>prevent</i>
				it from becoming established. This research can therefore help scholars and policy makers craft 
				national security strategies that take seriously the ecological threats posed by the creation
				of our own nuclear weapons. Environmental and nuclear disarmament organizations may use this 
				research to inform their strategies for addressing the intersecting and impending catastrophes 
				of global environmental change and nuclear weaponry.
