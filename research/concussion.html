			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Participation in youth sports is considered a rite of passage in American society. 
					While all youth sports involve concussion risk, numerous studies find that the
					highest rates of concussion occur in youth football. Between 2007 and 2014, all 
					U.S. states passed concussion legislation regulating youth sports participation. 
					Why were some U.S. states slower than others to pass concussion laws with return 
					to play restrictions? When states passed laws, why did some print media identify 
					youth football as the justification for enacting legislation, while others did not – 
					what explains this variation and how did the stories differ? <br>

			<h1>What did the researcher do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers first used an event history regression model to test two competing hypotheses 
					regarding youth sport participation and the timing of concussion legislation: constituency 
					vs. resistance. Discourse around concussions has focused on youth athletes as a population 
					at risk, which require risk-reduction medical policies to protect them. The amount of youth 
					sport participation in a state identifies a key group of at-risk individuals. If a disease 
					only affects a few individuals, it is less likely that medically informed laws will be passed. 
					
					<br><br>Constituency hypothesis: States with higher levels of youth sport participation will adopt concussion 
					legislation earlier. If legislation affects a large, at-risk population, organizations 
					are more likely to enact regulations quickly.<br><br>
						 
				Resistance hypothesis: States with higher levels of youth sport participation will adopt concussion 
					legislation later. Sport is an important activity with entrenched interests that are unlikely 
					to change quickly, and states with more youth athletes could be slower to pass concussion laws. <br><br>
				
				Next, researchers collected newspaper coverage of the passage of youth sports concussion laws in each state. 
					The framing of these laws involved different interest groups who attempted to shape laws and public 
					discourse. The NFL, scientists, public health officials, youth sports organizations, and parents 
					attempted to shape this framing and public discourse. This type of analysis reveals sources of cultural 
					and organized interest group power.<br>

			<h1>What did the researchers find?</h1>
				<h2>In the first analysis, the results support the resistance hypothesis - actors who support high school football 
					resisted efforts to medicalize youth concussions at the institutional level.<br>
					
					<ul><li>Social context helps determine why states pass medically informed legislation at different times.</li> 
					
						<li>States with more high school football participation passed concussion laws later.</li> 
						
						<li> States with a strong college football presence (SEC Conference membership) passed concussion laws later.</li>
						<li>States with more gender egalitarian views passed concussion laws earlier.</li>
					</ul>
				In the second analysis, researchers identified seven distinct themes in the newspaper reports of youth concussion legislation. 
					Only ten state newspaper accounts presented a critical perspective on the risk of youth football, and the vast majority 
					were hospitable to the NFL’s preferred framing that “all sports carry risk.” The findings point to contested processes. 
					Corporations (driven by profit) attempt to influence media behavior (driven by organizational preferences and journalistic practices). 
					<br><br>
				The NFL’s position was that all states needed to protect vulnerable youth athletes from concussions in every sport. 
					Most of the coverage emphasized a narrative that diluted the risks in youth football, directing positive attention 
					to the NFL’s youth sports advocacy. Simultaneously, coverage diverted focus from the scandal over the NFL’s handling of 
					concussions at the professional level. The NFL responded to highly publicized Congressional hearings by sending letters 
					to 44 states (National Football League, 2016), broadly advocating for changes that did not harm the NFL. This is a 
					prime example of the contested process of counterframing.

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>Policy makers and public health advocates can use this research to help craft public health strategies that address unique 
				social and cultural dynamics influencing the passage of public health law at the state level. Understanding these 
				unique processes can help legislators formulate more comprehensive strategies to address public health crises. 
				Public health organizations and health social movements can use this research to inform their strategies for targeting 
				public health problems in regions with greater resistance to these changes, and for identifying corporate strategies 
				of resistance and counterframing.
