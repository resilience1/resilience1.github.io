		<h2>The militarized war on drugs in Colombia has devastating environmental impacts. There is a long history of violent
			political conflict in Colombia, and numerous violent organizations attempt to control coca crops that supply
			a global cocaine market. The conflict - which drives deforestation, biodiversity loss, and landscape 
			transformation- demonstrates the new way that wars are conducted. In this new way of war, the risks of ecological 
			harms is concentrated in the Global South.

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2>Environmental destruction always results from war, but as war changes, so do its environmental 
					consequences. Modern wars are fought in a way that shifts environmental consequences to
					the Global South. Since the United States militarized its effort in the war on drugs in 1981,
					it has provided equipment, training, and weaponry to the Colombian state. Since 2000, the United 
					States has supported the Colombian state through "Plan Colombia." There are numerous 
					state and non-state violent groups participating in the war on drugs, and human rights abuses
					and environmental degradation are widespread. The United States remains insulated from the 
					environmental and human rights consequences of this war; Colombia bears the costs in war casualties,
					environmental damage, and the underdevelopment of peripheral regions where coca growing occurs.

			<h1>What did the researcher do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers located and analyzed academic research, media, and governmental publications
					on the environmental damage resulting from the militarized war on drugs in Colombia. They 
					identified historical and social factors that led to cocaine production and organized revolutionary 
					anti-government groups. They document American efforts to suppress the drug trade and the
					consequences for the Colombian government, the natural environment, and peoples of 
					Colombia.

			<h1>What did the researcher find?</h1>
				<h2>Despite the United States involvement in this conflict, the harmful environmental effects are
					disproportionately borne by Colombia. The Colombian military, paramilitary, guerilla, and criminal
					   forces all contribute to the environmental damage that occurs in Colombia. This is consistent
					   with how wars are now fought - consequences to the Global South.<br><br>
				</h2>
					   
				<h2>Eradicating cocaine production involves harmful environment consequences. For example, 
					aerial fumigation to destroy crops of cocaine-producing coca plants distributes harmful chemicals 
					into the environment, and these chemicals bioaccumulate and bioconcentrate in the food chain.
					The threats to biodiversity are significant because many newly established coca-growing
					regions are biodiversity "hotspots"; Colombia is home to the largest number of bird species
					in the world and the second highest number of plant species in the world. When the efforts to 
					eradicate coca plants affect crops, farmers either turn to producing coca themselves to supplement
					their income, or converting forested land into farmland, furthering the deforestation cycle. 
					Cocaine production involves unsustainable cultivation techniques and use of toxins. Coca leaves are ground into coca paste, which uses many harmful 
					chemicals, along with large amounts of water. Coca producers do not anticipate their crops being 
					around for many years and so use liberal amounts of chemicals on their plants, further 
					compromising the waterways.

			<h1>How can you use this research?</h1>
			<h2>Governments can be reminded that militarized efforts to suppress the drug trade have negative environmental
				consequences. Understanding the effects the drug trade has on the ecosystem can help governments create
				less damaging strategies to eradicate the drug trade. Environmental organisations may use this research
				to inform their strategies for areas where drug production is prevalent. This research has been used by
				the Colombian government to ban the use of aerial fumigation on coca crops.
