	<h1>What you need to know</h1>
		<h2>Enforcement first immigration policies are justified on racist and nativist grounds—to protect and insulate the 
    larger society from the “threat” posed by nonwhite immigrants. This nativist imagery suggests that risks are— similar 
    to the people detained in them— confined by the walls and fences that surround ICE facilities. However, this is a fantasy.
    The COVID-19 pandemic brought the blow back of nativist and racist immigration policy into sharp relief. Instead of making
    the United States safer, ICE detention facilities altered the riskscape and increased the risk of infection for the 
    residents of nearby communities and counties.

			<h1>What is this research about?</h1>
				<h2> Deciding to criminalize and detain immigrants (including those seeking asylum) generated
        a stream of unwelcome (if unintended) side effects that were fully anticipated. Even before
        the Trump presidency, ICE provided substandard health care. Because ICE failed to provide 
        readily available vaccines, ICE facilities were prone to (avoidable) outbreaks of mumps, flu, and other communicable diseases.
        Given this indifference to the health and well-being of people detained, the exacerbation of COVID-19 transmission
        in and near to ICE facilities was not the result of “error, ignorance, or blindness …. [The question is not why ICE
        officials and U.S. political leaders] failed to anticipate these effects but why, given the foreseen risks, they chose
        to go ahead anyway.”111 We argue that due to the callous cruelty that permeates ICE's policies and procedures, 
        the human, social, and political rights of people seeking to immigrate to the United States were routinely violated.
        This same callousness led ICE to persist in detention policies that gave rise to alarmingly high infection COVID-19 rates in ICE facilities.

			<h1>What did the researchers do?</h1>
				<h2>The researchers located and analyzed academic, government, and non-governmental data to understand 
					the impact of ICE facilities on the community spread of COVID-19. This research examined risks at 
          two spatial scales—specific to ICE facilities and among surrounding 
          communities. At both scales, we highlighted a distinction: the intentions of policy makers 
        and, whether or not unwelcome outcomes were intended, the degree to which policymakers anticipated
        (and permitted) these outcomes. As the Black Lives Movement and critical race literature have 
        documented, racist over-policing and mass incarceration policies were put in place with the 
        intention of intimidating and stigmatizing Black Americans. Although mass incarceration was 
        not designed to facilitate disease transmission, heightened infection rates in overcrowded 
        prisons and jails was well documented long before the COVID-19 pandemic.

			<h1>What did the researcher find?</h1>
				<h2>Warmaking drives carbon emissions even in times of global 
					Recession - when the slow-down of the global economy is reducing the impact of gross domestic product on carbon emissions.
					Risk-tranfer militarism in the Global North shifts the attendant risks of war to the peoples and the environments of the 
					Global South. While the Global North is pursuing a strategy that relies on carbon-intensive advanced weaponry,
					the Global South is investing in more boots on the ground. In addition to bearing the brundt of impacts from the Global North's
					asymmetric warfare, the Global South will also be the most impacted by global climate change driven by CO2 emissions.

				<h2>At a second—and more diffused—spatial scale, ICE facilities were part of the riskscape of surrounding communities and counties.
        The ICE controlled the movement, living conditions, and opportunities for disease mitigation for those detained, whereas ICE did 
        not control public health policy making among nearby communities. At this spatial scale, the concept of blow back offers insights.113 
        When deploying chemical and biological weapons, the intent is to inflict harm on enemy troops.<br><br>
        
        Although generals and admirals cannot prevent the drift of chemical and biological weapons (resulting in casualties and deaths among 
        their own troops), they fully anticipate these unwelcome consequences. In the same vein, the blow back (in this case, an elevated infection
        rate in surrounding communities) that flowed from the spike in COVID-19 infections in ICE facilities was predicted by the people 
        detained by ICE, public health officials, and immigrant advocacy groups.
