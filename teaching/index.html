		<h1><b><center>Environmental Sociology</center></b></h1>
	<h2> The goal of the course is to deepen collective understanding of the dynamics of power and inequality that shape human 
		societies and the natural environment. The class pursues this goal by contextualizing the early work, 
		reviewing core theories in environmental sociology, and using these newfound theoretical skills to consider 
		inequality, justice, social movements, and other topics of relevance to contemporary human-environment 
		interactions.</h2>

		<h1><b><center>Statistics and Probability</center></b></h1>
	<h2>	The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to some basic statistical concepts and techniques. 
		The material we cover prepares students for more advanced statistical courses. We explore a variety of topics, 
		including graphical and numerical univariate statistics, graphical and numerical bivariate statistics, 
		probability, sampling distributions, and statistical inference.</h2>

		<h1><b><center>Research Methods</center></b></h1>
	<h2>	This course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of research methods.
		We emphasize issues such as the logic of research design, issues of conceptualization and measurement, 
		the range of data collection methods available to scientists, and social scientists in particular, and
		what scientists do with the data once they have collected it.</h2>

		<h1><b><center>Sociology of Film</center></span></b></h1>
	<h2>	The Sociology of Film examines the content of films and how this content is shaped by the structure of
		the film industry. In short, it seeks to understand the influence of “Hollywood” on the content of “Hollywood” films.
		In so doing, it examines the inevitable tension between art and economics within the film industry.  This course 
		covers a series of topics related to the film production and film content. It examines the types of stories that
		films tell and the way those stories are told using various film techniques. It also examines the structure the
		film industry and how it influences the content of films. Finally, it examines the division of creative labor 
		within the film industry and how creative artists influence the content of these same films. In the final analysis,
		this course seeks to understand how films can be both a commodity and an art.</h2><br>
