	<font size="6">Environmental Sociology</font>
		<p> This course aims to provide students with a selective overview of major approaches and debates shaping 
		the field of environmental sociology. While the course is specifically intended to provide general background 
		to sociology students interested in environmental sociology, it is not limited to such students. Our more 
		general goal is to deepen collective understanding of the dynamics of power and inequality that shape human 
		societies and the natural environment. The class will pursue this goal by contextualizing the early work, 
		reviewing core theories in environmental sociology, and using these newfound theoretical skills to consider 
		inequality, justice, social movements, and other topics of relevance to contemporary human-environment 
		interactions.</p><br><br>
		
	<font size="6">Statistics and Probability</font><br><p>

             The primary goal of this course is to introduce students to some basic statistical concepts and techniques. 
             The material we cover prepares students for more advanced statistical courses. We explore a variety of topics,
             including graphical and numerical univariate statistics, graphical and numerical bivariate statistics, 
             probability, sampling distributions, and statistical inference.</p><br><br>
	
	<font size="6">Methods</font><br><p> This course is designed to provide students with a basic understanding of research methods.
            We emphasize issues such as the logic of research design, issues of conceptualization and measurement, the range
            of data collection methods available to scientists, and social scientists in particular, and what scientists do
            with the data once they have collected it.</p><br><br>
	
	<font size="6">Sociology of Film</font><br><p> The Sociology of Film examines the content of films and how this content is 
              shaped by the structure of the film industry. In short, it seeks to understand the influence of “Hollywood”
              on the content of “Hollywood” films. In so doing, it examines the inevitable tension between art and economics
              within the film industry.  This course covers a series of topics related to the film production and film content.
              It examines the types of stories that films tell and the way those stories are told using various film techniques.
              It also examines the structure the film industry and how it influences the content of films. Finally, it examines 
              the division of creative labor within the film industry and how creative artists influence the content of 
              these same films. In the final analysis, this course seeks to understand how films can be both a commodity 
              and an art.<p><br>
